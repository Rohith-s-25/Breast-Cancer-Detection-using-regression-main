# Breast-Cancer-Detection-using-regression
The project is about Breast Cancer Detection. One of the common problems faces today is Breast Cancer among women and men. So, the Detection at the early stages is a mandate to minimize the complexity. This project will make a performance comparison between different machine learning algorithms .
